# Debounce_Multiple_Buttons

This file is a simple template that can be used for projects that require using multiple pushbuttons on a breadboard.
The majority of the pushbuttons I own refuse to stay perfectly flat and inserted all the way into my breadboard, which generates a lot of noise.
This program filters out the noise and adds some consitency and dependability to projects that use pushbuttons.

The LEDs are used to show you how responsive and consistent the pushbuttons become when using debouncing. The resistor for each LED was determined experimentally to give the best colour.

Pin Layout & Resistors Used:
2 - First button
3 - Second button
4 - Third button
5 - Fourth button

8 - Red LED (47Ω + 100Ω)
9 - Yellow LED (470Ω)
10 - Green LED (47Ω)
11 - Blue LED (10KΩ)

GND - Both breadboards
5V - Button breadboard
