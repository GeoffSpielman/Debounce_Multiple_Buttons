# Debounce_Multiple_Buttons

This file is a simple template that can be used for projects that require using multiple pushbuttons on a breadboard.
The majority of the pushbuttons I own refuse to stay perfectly flat and inserted all the way into my breadboard, which generates a lot of noise.
This program filters out the noise and adds some consitency and dependability to projects that use pushbuttons.
